## Outcomes and thoughts

Recently, I had the great pleasure of being a speaker at one of the [Andersen People](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7211371823534338048/) meetups, where I presented on 
the topic of "Building Nanoservices with Azure Functions." It was an amazing experience, and Iâ€™d like to share some thoughts and outcomes from it. First and foremost, Iâ€™m incredibly grateful to the organizers and attendees for creating such a great and inspiring atmosphere.

The topic itself was quite challenging to dive into. The primary reason for this is that it sparked a chain of questions that needed answers. To get closer to understanding nanoservices, it was necessary first to explore more traditional architectural styles, such as monolithic applications and microservices-based systems. Additionally, it was essential to highlight the relationship between nanoservices and the serverless paradigm. However, this required delving into other concepts of cloud computing.

> ðŸ’¡Important side topics
> 
> Although many of these aspects are not directly related to the main topic, it was important to mention them to illustrate the contrast between nanoservices and other system design approaches.

After analyzing the scope we covered and the questions from the audience, I realize that this is definitely not the 
last talk Iâ€™d like to present on this subject. Next time, weâ€™ll dive deeper into more advanced and applied aspects. `So, stay tuned!`
