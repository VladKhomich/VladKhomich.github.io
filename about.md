Hi there! My name is Ulad and I work as a software developer. As you could guess based on your address line, my main technical stack includes .NET, React and Azure.

### Things that drive me

I'm a huge fan of serverless solutions and cloud in general. I have successfully achieved the Azure AZ-900 
certification, it can be verified [via link](https://learn.microsoft.

### What inspires me
What inspires me is my active participation in technical interviews and assessments at my current company. I strongly believe that working as a technical interviewer helps me stay in good shape and keep up with the modern trends of the market.
